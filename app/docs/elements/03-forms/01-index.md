## Optional and mandatory fields

- only ask for the information you absolutely need
- if you do ask for optional information, mark the labels of optional fields with ‘(optional)’
- don’t mark mandatory fields with asterisks

## Fieldsets and legends

Use fieldsets to group related form controls. The first element inside a fieldset must be a legend element which describes the group.
