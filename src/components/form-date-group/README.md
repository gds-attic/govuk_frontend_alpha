To ask for memorable dates, like dates of birth, use text fields for users to complete.

## Asking for memorable dates

Use 3 fields as it’ll be easier for you to validate each part rather than trying to review a single field.

Don’t automatically tab users between fields because this can clash with normal keyboard controls and confuse people.

Calendar controls aren’t particularly useful for known dates and some users struggle with select boxes.
